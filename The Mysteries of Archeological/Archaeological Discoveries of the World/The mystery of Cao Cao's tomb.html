<div class="page_title">The mystery of Cao Cao's tomb</div>

  <p>Cao Cao, the founder of the Wei Kingdom in the Three Kingdoms era, was a highly controversial figure. He did not become an emperor during his lifetime, but was forced to be named Emperor Wei Wu after his death. The "Three Kingdoms" written by Chen Shou praised him as "a very extraordinary person, a superhuman hero". The Romance of the Three Kingdoms written by Luo Guanzhong, however, called him a "Han thief" and "Traitor." The Three Kingdoms drama adapted from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms also portrayed him as a big-faced adulterer, making him a wife and a child. Characters.</p>
<p>In his later years, Cao Cao arranged for himself. In The Three Kingdoms, he wrote an order two years before his death, asking him to build a shouling for him on the barren land on the west plateau of the Ximen Leopard Temple. "Do not close the tree" means that the mausoleum should be built on a high ground. Do not pile up high tombs on the ground, and do not make any marks. "The Three Kingdoms" also mentioned that in the first month of the twenty-fifth year of Jian'an, 220 years ago, Cao Cao died in Luoyang. In February, he was buried in Gaoling. This Gaoling may refer to the Shouling already built on the west gate of Ximen Leopard Temple. However, in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao's will when he died was another way of saying that he told people to set up 72 suspects outside Wucheng in Zhangde House, so that future generations would not know where his body was buried. Fear of someone digging his grave. Although "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is a novel, it is mainly based on Pei Songzhi's "Three Kingdoms Annotation", but it has only done some literary processing, and the content is seven-point documentary and three-point fiction. Then it must record the truth about Cao Cao's tomb after he died. In this way, the records of the tomb of Cao Cao have different opinions: one is on the west gate of Ximen Leopard Temple, known as Gaoling, and the other is the city of Zhangde, which has 72 suspects.</p>
<p>To figure out where Cao Cao's tomb is, you must first understand where the Ximen Leopard Temple and Changde Mansion are located. There is a record of Ximen Leopard governance in history, so the Ximen Leopard Temple must be in Wucheng, that is, the capital of Cao Cao when he was named Wei Dynasty, which is Linzhang at the junction of Hebei and Henan today. The former Changde Mansion did not actually have this place name during the Three Kingdoms. It was only available during the Jin Dynasty, that is, Anyang City at the junction of Henan and Hebei today. Linzhang and Anyang, which belong to Hebei and Henan provinces today, are next to each other. In ancient times, when the provinces were not divided, those two places were most often called Qicheng, and in the Jin Dynasty, they were cupped in Changde House. All in all, the city and Chande House are actually one place. Because the Ximen Panthers have brought great benefits to the people around the city, there are many Ximen Panther Temples in Linzhang, including Anyang City today. According to the "Three Kingdoms", Cao Cao's tomb is on the West Plains in your west. However, it is difficult to determine which Ximen Leopard Temple, because it is a "tomb without a tree" and there is no sign. It is difficult to find it.</p>
<p>Some people think that although Cao Cao stipulated that his mausoleum was "not sealed," but when his son Cao Bu waited for his burial, it was impossible to make no mark at all for the purpose of the grave sacrifice. No matter what? I am afraid this is not reasonable, and it is not in line with the Chinese filial piety of "going to the end with caution". "Three Kingdoms" clearly records that Cao Cao's tomb is called Gaoling. Even if it is "not sealed," there may still be a village called Gaoling in the place name. If we can carry out an in-depth excavation and census of the old and new place names in Linzhang and Anyang today, we may find some clues about the tomb of Cao Cao. So is there 72 suspects in Wucheng, Changde Prefecture? Today, eight miles west of Santai Village, Linzhang County, there is indeed a place called Wucheng. Some people think that it may be the Changdefu Jiangwu in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. From there, west to Cixian, which is the area around Fengle Town in the northern suburbs of Anyang today, there are indeed many large mounds like hilltops. Some people call them "Cao Cao's Tomb". These may be the so-called 72 suspects. Some people had previously digged some of them, and indeed some tombstones and the like were excavated, but those were the domains of the king ministers of the Northern Wei and Beiqi era, two or three hundred years later than Cao Cao. If those big mounds were indeed Cao Cao ’s suspects, they were later attacked and built by graves and ministers of the Northern Wei and Northern Qi dynasties. Then I wonder if they had dug deep when they attacked the grave and whether there was one of them Excavation of Cao Cao's body or other funerary related to it. Throughout the history books of the Northern Wei and Northern Qi Dynasties, no such records were found.</p>
<p>Some people also think that Cao Cao asked to repair 72 suspects before he was alive. They were deliberately laid out. It is likely that 72 suspects were empty, and Cao Cao's body was buried in another secret place. The resourceful Cao Cao couldn't have imagined it. If he was buried in one of the 72 suspected homes, later generations would dig up all the suspected homes, wouldn't he find his body? Cao Cao would never be so stupid. From ancient times to the present, many scholars and writers have visited the home of Cao Cao 72 suspected in the area of ​​Wucheng to Fengle Town, and wanted to explore and inspect Cao Cao's tomb, but nothing was gained. Cao Cao once said: "Rather teach me to lose the world, and leave the world to lose me." During his lifetime, he set up many schemes and deceived many people. When he died, he even set up such a secret scheme to prevent future generations from knowing where his tomb is. From this, we can see that Cao Mengde is cunning, suspicious, and devoted to scheming. Character traits.</p>
