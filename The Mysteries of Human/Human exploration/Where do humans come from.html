<div class="page_title">Where do humans come from</div>

  <p>Where does humanity come from? This is the mystery that Chinese and foreign scientists and philosophers have been contemplating and discussing for thousands of years. The origin of mankind has been listed with the origin of the universe, the origin of the earth, and the origin of life as the four major mysteries. And the mysteries of these four origins are criss-crossed and interconnected. If one of them can be solved, it will be a major breakthrough for the other three origins.</p>
<p>Human beings have always been concerned about where they come from and how they came about. This concerns the status of man in the natural universe. Is human status paramount or humble?</p>
<p>What is human nature? What should man do to nature? What is human ability? ......... This is what we want to know and need to explore. Because, it is our root.</p>
<p>Only when human beings find their roots can they find the basis for development in the tide of history. On this basis, a beacon of civilization is established to defend the fate of themselves, the earth, and the entire planet.</p>
<p>There have been many opinions on the origin of human beings.</p>
<p>Darwin was a shabby master of British academia in the 19th century. He suffered from dysentery and studied hard for life to explore the laws of nature. His book "The Origin of Species" came out in 1859, summed up his own years of personal observations of biological phenomena around the world, discovered the role of natural selection in species change, and explored the origin and evolution of species. Although Darwin did not directly link the origin of species to humans at that time, he only said one sentence: through the publication of "The Origin of Species", "the beginning of human history will give a glimmer of light to the beginning of human history." The publication of this book launched unprecedented serious challenges to the religious myths of God's creation and the feudal ethics supported by creationism. At that time, the conservative forces' resistance and the huge shock of the social ideological circle prevented Darwin, who had always paid attention to not going beyond the thunder of the natural sciences. He was angry to collect sufficient objective facts to reveal the mysteries of human origin. Finally, 12 years after the publication of "Origin of Species" in 1871, he published the great work "Origin of Humanity" to clarify his previously formed ideas, The general theory of the origin of species is also fully applicable to a natural species such as man. He not only confirmed that human organisms evolved from some relatively low-level structures, but also believed that the characteristics of spiritual civilization, such as human intelligence, human social morality, and emotional psychological foundations, are also like the origin of the human body structure. It can be traced back to the stage of lower animals, and laid the foundation for the field of human research. This is an unprecedented breakthrough in the development of human history.</p>
<p>After the birth of Marxism, Engels used dialectical materialism and historical materialism to synthesize scientific achievements, comprehensively analyzed the process from ape to man, and created the theory of "labor creates man", which fundamentally shattered God's creation of man. Religious superstition myth. Labor plays a decisive role in the transformation from ape to human. Whether it is the division of hands and feet, the manufacture of tools, or the emergence of language, brain development, and the emergence of thinking, they all appear in labor. So Engels said: "Labor is the first basic condition of the entire human society ... In a sense, it must be said that labor creates man itself."</p>
<p>In 1960, British anthropologist Sir Lister Hardy provided a new hypothesis that he believed that the human ancestors of the fossil blank period (almost blank fossil data in this period from 4 million to 8 million years ago) , Not living on land, but living in the sea; in the history of human evolution, there are millions of years of aquatic sea ape stage, this stage has left many "traces" on humans so far-anatomical and physiological aspects These characteristics are not found in other terrestrial primates, but they are also found in aquatic mammals such as seals and dolphins. For example: All primates have thick hair on their surfaces, but humans are just like water beasts with bare skin; primates have no subcutaneous fat, while humans have thick subcutaneous fat like water beasts. The place where the human fetus's hair is born is obviously different from other primates, but close to the water beast. The physiological phenomenon of human lacrimal glands secreting tears and expelling salt is also a characteristic of water beasts, which is unique among primates. Hardy pointed out: Geological history shows that from 4 million to 8 million years ago, in the eastern and northern parts of Africa, there was a large area where a sea ape lived. Millions of years later, seawaters receded, and sea apes that had adapted to aquatic life returned to land, and they were human ancestors. The sea apes have experienced vicissitudes and evolved their biped erecting and breathing control skills in aquatic life, creating conditions for major evolutionary steps such as walking upright, liberating their hands, and developing language communication. This made them "uniquely endowed", surpassed other apes, and evolved into the highest intelligent animal on the planet.</p>
<p>Comparing the physiological characteristics of different animals, we can see the distance between them. This is a comparative physiological research method. Apelika Danton, a biology professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia, has studied the physiological mechanisms by which humans and other mammals control salt balance in the body. He found that in this respect, humans are also different from all terrestrial mammals, but similar to water beasts.</p>
<p>Other experts point out that the diving physiology of humans is very good. Where ancient ape people lived, people found a famous monument: the prehistoric shell family. Shellfish are piles of shells, which is evidence of prehistoric ancient people eating shellfish. In 1983, British scientists Elmer and Gordon discovered the ancient shellfish there, such as Tanla and Amata in Africa, where they found blind apes, and found that these shellfish are all species that live in the deep sea, such as oyster , Mussels, etc. You need to master the techniques of breath-holding diving to collect these shellfish. Obviously, these apes have excellent diving skills, which are also unique among primates. Humans are natural divers, and they hold their breath for much longer than other creatures. When humans dive, a diving reaction occurs in the body, muscle contraction, decreased arterial blood flow, apnea, and slow heartbeat. This response is very similar to the water response of aquatic animals such as seals and sea ducks. The diving response is not conditioned reflex, but is controlled by the brain's advanced center. This control also consciously controls breathing. The precise control and regulation of breathing is the basis of human language development. Without this ability to control breathing formed at the sea ape stage, humans cannot develop such a complex vocal method.</p>
<p>In recent years, a series of discoveries have re-awakened people's enthusiasm for the extraterrestrial source of life. First of all, people noticed that despite the variety of life on Earth, it has a pattern, similar cell structure, genetic material composed of the same RNA, and living organisms composed of proteins. This makes one cannot help asking, if life really evolved from inorganic matter on the earth, why wouldn't there be multiple modes of life? Secondly, others have noticed that the rare metal molybdenum has an important role in the physiological activities of life on Earth. However, the content of platinum in the earth's crust is very low, only 0.0002%, which also makes one wonder, why is such a rare element so important to life? Will life on earth originate in other celestial bodies that are rich? Third, people continue to find organic matter originating from interstellar space from meteorites that fell from the sky, including all the basic elements that make up the life of the earth. At the same time, people have discovered organic molecules in many parts of the universe. This has convinced many people that life is far more than a monopoly for the planet.</p>
<p>Some people have also noticed that some infectious diseases on the planet, such as influenza, often periodically spread globally. And its spread cycle matches the return cycle of some comets. So this gave them reason to wonder if some infectious vaccines came from comets? If so, is the person a foreigner?</p>
