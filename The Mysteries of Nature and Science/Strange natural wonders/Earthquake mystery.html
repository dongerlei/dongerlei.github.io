  <p>On December 16, 1920, a magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck Haiyuan, Ningxia, China, killing 200,000 people;</p>
<p>On September 1, 1923, a magnitude 8.3 earthquake struck Kanto, Japan, killing 100,000 people, missing the whereabouts of 40,000 people, and losing about $ 15.6 billion in economic losses;</p>
<p>On February 4, 1976, the Guatemala earthquake killed 26,000 people and injured more than 60,000 people in just 39 seconds;</p>
<p>On July 28, 1976, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Tangshan, Hebei, China killed 242,000 people, seriously injured 164,000 people, and caused economic losses of tens of billions.</p>
<p>In 1994, the Los Angeles earthquake in the United States caused direct economic losses of more than $ 20 billion;</p>
<p>On January 17, 1995, the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Japan killed more than 51,300 people, injured more than 26,000 people, destroyed 56,000 houses, and caused economic losses of hundreds of billions of dollars;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Earthquakes are one of the most natural disasters to humanity. According to statistics, between 1900 and 1979, nearly 600 severe catastrophic earthquakes occurred worldwide, killing more than 1.2 million people. The total number of people killed in the earthquake in China since the 20th century has reached 550,000. The earthquake was like a huge monster. Not only took the lives of tens of thousands of people, but also destroyed countless properties in an instant. At the same time, it also formed secondary disasters such as fires, tsunamis, floods, landslides, subsidences, volcanic eruptions, and plagues, and its scenes were shocking. In order to overcome the earthquake damage, mankind has done thousands of years of exploration and research on the earthquake. The ancient Chinese people and scientists have made outstanding contributions to the study of earthquakes, not only leaving rich seismic records, but also accumulating a large amount of seismic knowledge and proposing many methods for earthquake prediction. The "Book of Songs" has a record of the great earthquake of the Western Zhou Dynasty in 780 BC: "Earthquake electricity, restlessness, boiling rivers, boiling mountains, killing valleys on high shores, and tombs on deep valleys." There are ancient people's summary of the earthquake precursors: "About winter and spring are mostly, such as well water suddenly turbid, the sound of artillery, barking dogs, that is to prevent this disease." In particular, ancient Chinese scientists had great inventions in seismic instruments. The world's first earthquake-monitoring instrument, a ground motion instrument, was invented by China's Zhang Heng in 132 AD. This instrument was born nearly 1700 years earlier than similar foreign instruments. It was "made of fine copper, with a diameter of eight feet and a raised lid that looks like a wine bottle." On March 1, 138 AD, its western dragon mouth opened. Wei Gong actually measured the Longxi earthquake, which became a great invention that was far ahead of the world at that time. It is still researched and promoted by Chinese and foreign scientists. Through the study of earthquake historical materials and observations of previous earthquakes, human beings have unveiled the mysterious veil of earthquake "monsters", and believe that earthquakes can be predicted and predicted, and human beings have the ability to prevent and resist earthquakes. To this end, mankind has established seismology, earthquake history, and quake science, which has promoted the formation and development of earthquake science and technology.</p>
<p>Earthquake is also called ground motion, which refers to the vibration caused by the rock breaking and moving due to the huge pressure inside the earth. It is a manifestation of crustal movement, which can be roughly divided into three types: tectonic earthquake, volcanic earthquake and subsidence earthquake. The source can be on land or in the ocean. In order to prevent the sudden attack of earthquakes, many countries have established corresponding management institutions and research institutes to strengthen earthquake prediction and forecasting work and improve human's own earthquake resistance. After the earthquake in Xingtai, Hebei, China, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai, the National Earthquake Administration was established in 1970, making China the only country in the world today that is organized by the state and performs seismic monitoring and forecasting nationwide.</p>
<p>In terms of earthquake prediction, there were initially only long-term and short-term forecasts in the world. With the development of modern science and technology, people have invented a variety of seismic monitoring instruments. At present, there are more than 500 large-scale networked seismograph stations on each continent, which facilitates timely and accurate capture of the earthquake's whereabouts. China has established about 900 small earthquakes and various precursory observing stations, and 21 regional and local telemetry seismic networks. Ten digital seismograph stations and 30,000 kilometers of deformation, gravity, and geomagnetic flow lines have been set up to form a large-scale observation system, and a national and regional communication system has been established. At present, people can make successful predictions and predictions of earthquakes through changes in ground form, groundwater, geomagnetic field, gravity field, ground temperature, ground stress, and geoacoustic, light, and seismic clouds. Before the Longling earthquake in 1976, a watchman saw an orange-red light band appear in the sky. He immediately judged that it was ground light, and quickly sounded the alarm to evacuate people in time to avoid earthquake casualties. Similarly, in 1979, the mayor of Kenta, Nara, Japan, saw a strip-shaped cloud at the Beijing Hotel during his visit to China, and then, like the Chinese earthquake workers, used the seismic cloud to predict the earthquake in Puyang, Jiangsu. The prediction of China's 7.3 magnitude earthquake in the East China Sea in 1995 was successfully listed by UNESCO as the only international event that successfully predicted destructive earthquakes. China's earthquake prediction is at the forefront of the world.</p>
<p>China has also made great achievements in earthquake prediction research. Chinese Academy of Sciences Ma Zongjin enjoys international reputation in this regard. His staged and progressive forecasting theory has been hailed as "China's earthquake prediction model" by the international community. Therefore, in March 1977, Ma Zongjin was invited by the Romanian government to conduct an inspection and discussion on the Franca cloud area, which calmed down the storm caused by the misinformation of "Voice of the United States". He was also invited to the country by the United States in 1987 Go to school. Earthquake research has improved the level of earthquake prediction, and has also strengthened the ability of humans to resist earthquakes and earthquakes. First, people try to improve the earthquake resistance of houses as much as possible. During the Tangshan earthquake in China, most of the buildings were damaged, and the Tangshan flour mill was built at an 8-degree fortification. Even when it was hit by a 10-degree destructive earthquake, it was not severely damaged. Secondly, adhere to the road of "prevention-oriented and comprehensive earthquake prevention and disaster reduction", and pay attention to the four work links of earthquake prediction, earthquake disaster prevention, earthquake emergency response, and post-earthquake relief and reconstruction. On October 17, 1989, a major earthquake struck San Francisco, and a wonderful baseball game was being held in a stadium in the city. The earthquake suddenly occurred and the game was suspended, but thousands of spectators sat calmly in place and none escaped. This is the result of the US's usual emphasis on education in earthquake defense and national psychological endurance. China also has a model in this regard.On the eve of the Tangshan Earthquake in mid-July 1976, when the city's Qinglong County convened a third-level cadre meeting, it received news from the National Prevention Center about the earthquake in the second half of the year. Work was deployed, earthquake shelters were generally set up, and monitoring stations were set up. As a result, none of the county was injured when more than 200,000 people died in Tangshan City. The county's experience has been valued by the United Nations.</p>
<p>As a science, earthquake science is not yet perfect, and earthquake prediction is still quite difficult. However, the results of earthquake research have led people to believe that human beings can defend against this disaster. In 1987, the 42nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 169, deciding to carry out "international disaster reduction" activities from 1990 to 2000, and earthquakes have been included in the research work on natural disaster systems as an important content. Humans will eventually sound the alarm before the earthquake.</p>
