<div class="page_title">The mystery of the origin of words</div>

  <p>Words have become an indispensable communication tool in modern society, but the origin of words is not an issue that can be easily concluded.</p>
<p>The oldest pictographs confirmed by paleographers are around 3500 BC. They appeared in Mesopotamia, one of the birthplaces of human civilization, and there are about 12 pictures on both sides of a marble tablet a few inches square. It is clear that a major event is recorded here. After the text on the drawing, there appeared a "riddle text" combining concrete with abstraction. Most archeologists believe that this text form appeared in the two river basins in 1800 BC. Syllable text is probably a stage before the final formation of alphabetic text. The texts at this stage are: Sumerian script in 3100 BC, Egyptian script in about 3000 BC, and original Indian script in 2200 BC. , Cretan linear script in 2000 BC, Hittite script in 1500 BC, oracle script around 1300 BC. Alphabetical text is the last stage of the development of the text, marking the arrival of standardization of the text. Some scholars believe that Semitic speakers in places such as Lestan and Syria have developed alphabetic characters, including certain vowels, using Egyptian vocabulary and the first pronunciation of the vocabulary. However, the great power scholar Gerpa believed that the first thing that could be called justice and justice was called Greek. The fattening proprietors developed the vowel system, and created the first heads and consonants. Combined with the first complete alphabetic system in the 9th century BC. Other researchers believe that as early as 1800 BC, the best researchers think that as early as 1800 BC, this great creation was completed.</p>
<p>There are always many difficult arguments about the origin, time, region, and form of writing, and it is difficult to figure out a uniform development stage.</p>
