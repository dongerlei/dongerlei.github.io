<div class="page_title">The mystery of nuclear war more than five thousand years ago</div>

  <p>There is a famous ancient Indian epic "Mahabara," a translation of "Mahaparada," an ancient Sanskrit narrative poem in India, which sounds like "the great queen of Boroto" and describes the harmony of the class. The struggle between the two races for the throne of Lu and the Ramayana is called India's two major epics) = 1500 BC, which is about 3,500 years ago. It is said that the historical facts recorded in the book are two thousand years earlier than the time when the book was completed, that is to say, this property occurred about 5,000 years ago. This book chronicles two fierce wars between the Kolava and Pandawa, Frishni, and Anhaka residents of the upper Ganges of India. The first war in the book is described as follows: "The heroic Atvartan, sitting firmly in Vimana (aircraft-like aircraft), landed in the water and launched" Agnia ", a missile-like weapon , Can produce and emit dense flame arrows over the enemy, such as the same rainstorm, surrounded the enemy, infinite power. Suddenly, a thick shadow quickly formed over Pandawa, the sky darkened, all in the darkness All the compasses failed, and then began to blow violent winds, howling, bringing up dust, gravel, birds screaming madly ... it seemed like the sky was falling apart. "" The sun seemed to be swaying in the air, this weapon issued The terrible scorching caused the ground to shake. In a large area, animals were deformed, rivers were boiling, fish and shrimp were all burned to death. When the rocket broke out, it thundered and burned the enemy soldiers like a burnt trunk. "The second time The description of the war is even more creepy and frightening: "Gurka took a fast Vimana and fired a missile at three enemy cities. This missile seems to have the entire cosmic power and its brightness is like ten thousand. sun, Pillar of fire rolling sky or people, very spectacular. "No identifiable body was burned, hair and nails fell off, ceramics burst, the birds are flying high temperature burning coke. To escape death, the soldiers jumped into the river to wash themselves and their weapons. "</p>
<p>I believe that everyone who reads this text will have the same feelings, such as the terrible war and such a huge degree of destruction can not help but think of the United States after the World War II, after dropping bullets in Hiroshima and Nagasaki scene. This text is almost a vivid portrayal of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Was there a nuclear war on Earth more than 5,000 years ago? According to the existing historical data of human beings, in 5000 BC, people were concerned about the life of slash and burn, how could it be possible to possess nuclear weapons and launch a nuclear war, so historians agree that Indian epics in the past were just poetic exaggerations. The nuclear war that took place thousands of years ago was nothing short of fateful. However, many people have also raised doubts. They pointed out that "Nie An Luo Duo" described the war vividly and vividly as if they were there. If it is not true, there would be no such detailed description by imagination alone. .</p>
<p>At the same time, some archeologists' findings have also tended to confirm that a nuclear war has indeed broken out. In 1922, a world-famous archeological discovery about ancient cities was born. This is the "Mahenzo Dharma" in Sindh, India.</p>
<p>The Indus River is one of the longest rivers in the world and a birthplace of human civilization. From the 19th century, people found a large number of ruins belonging to the same civilization in the area of ​​Kronpshire on the Indian River. The area covered by the same civilization is unique in the world. This is " Indian civilization. " The most famous of these are the ruins of two ancient cities, Haraba and Mahhenzo Dharma (Indian for Death Valley). According to the most conservative estimates, they are at least 5,000 years ago, but there are no records of these two ancient cities in early Indian myths, so more people think that their history may be much longer than expected. In the excavation of city buildings, archaeologists could not find temples and palaces at all, which is different from the remains of ancient cities currently excavated in the world. It seems that these cities have no rulers at all. The residential buildings in Mahendor Dharma City confirm this point. All the houses are built of brick and wood. They are basically the same in terms of the scale of the layout. It seems that the rich and the poor did not appear here, and no art was found. Was it not there, or was it destroyed over time? A large number of remains have been unearthed here, some on the street, and more in the living room. In a relatively large ruin, people were found dying in rows, some covering their faces with both hands, as if protecting themselves, and as if they saw something terrifying. To be sure, everyone died suddenly. There must have been a huge anomaly in this ancient city. What was it? volcanic eruptions? But within a few thousand kilometers of this area, people have not found the remaining craters; is it an epidemic or plague that erupts suddenly? But it is medically proven that plagues and epidemics cannot suddenly destroy a city. Indian archaeologist Kaha conducted a detailed chemical analysis of the unearthed human bones and said: "I found traces of high temperature heating in 9 white bones. This shows the destruction of Maheno and Dharma and the death and sudden appearance of people. It is related to the high temperature. Maheno's Dharma and the destruction of Sodom in the Bible are very similar. They were suddenly destroyed by high temperature and heavenly things. People also found in many collapsed buildings in Mahénzo Dharma. There are some traces of high temperature on the object, people even found some "glass building" -Torritini substance. The formation of this substance was caused by the instant high temperature melting the surface of the object and then rapidly cooling. To the public only in the heat These man-made substances have been found at the scene of the nuclear weapon explosion. All evidence shows that there has been a nuclear explosion here.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the Ghentrim Valley of Turkey, not far from Jerusalem, we were surprised to find that the surface here is extremely similar to the surface of the moon. Similarly, similar ruins were found in Chonggu Nupi and the Sahara Desert. In addition, archeologists have found cities built underground in many parts of the world. These underground cities are extremely scientific in design. There are vents and neat rows. A city is extremely scientific in design. There are vents and neat rows. The purpose of the whole city seems to be to provide shelter for people. So what are people trying to avoid? What makes people have to hide underground?</p>
<p>It is implying that there was a nuclear war in prehistory. If mathematics has some kind of explanation about time, I don't know if the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima can "post-morning". Although a lot of literature and archeological excavations have provided clues for this, it is still an eternal mystery whether human beings raised nuclear weapons and did not have nuclear wars and nuclear wars destroyed these civilizations 5000 years ago.</p>
