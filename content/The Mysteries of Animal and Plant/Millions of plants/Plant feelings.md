Since the 20th century, a large number of research results by scientists from Russia, the United States, and Japan have shown that plants have brains, not only show emotions, but also endure pain, starvation, and compassion.

The former Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Moscow did an experiment. The roots of the plants were placed in hot water. The apparatus immediately heard the call of despair.

Yale University experiments show that plants have memory. First place two plants side by side in the house, and let one person destroy one plant as one plant. Then let him mingle in a six-man team (all with a face-to-face order)-come, and when the destroyer comes over, the living plant leaves a strong signal indication on the instrument recording paper.

Scientists have discovered that not only humans know how to love and hate, but plants also have "love" and "hate."

Scientists have proved through experiments that onions and carrots are good friends, and the smell they emit can repel each other's pests. Soy likes to get along with castor. The odor emitted by castor makes the golden electrons that harm soybeans daunting. Between corn and peas, they grow robustly and benefit from each other. The vineyard is planted with violets, and the grapes that are "friendly to coexist" with each other have a stronger aroma. Interestingly, British scientists have mixed seeds with roots, leaves, and roots that emit chemical substances, and mixed with undergrowth, and grew large radish in half a month.

Some plants have "bloods of blood and deep hatred" and are "incompatible with each other". Cabbage and mustard are a pair of enemies. Narcissus and San Xiu want to be neighbors. When they grow up together, they will "grow together." White flowers and wood clogs live together with wheat, corn, and sunflower, and they will beat wheat and other crops. Cabbage and celery, cucumber and tomato, wheat and corn, sorghum and sesame are all rivals.
