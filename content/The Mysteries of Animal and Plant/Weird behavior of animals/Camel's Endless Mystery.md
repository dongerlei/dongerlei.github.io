Camels known as Desert Boats are known for their ability to endure dry and hot summers. They can travel long distances in vast deserts with extreme temperature differences between day and night, and become the best companions for people's desert trips. For a long time, people have been curious about this magical ability of camels, hoping to unlock the drought resistance of camels.

The earliest theory to explain the drought resistance of camels is the "water sac theory". Those who hold this theory believe that camels are ruminants. There are three compartments in the stomach, the largest of which is the rumen. There are many muscle bands in the tumor. The world is divided into several parts, so that it functions as a water bladder. When the water source is sufficient, the water bladder stores some water for thirst.

However, some other scientists quickly overturned this theory. Through anatomy, it was found that the water sac cannot be effectively separated from the rest of the rumen, and the individual is too small to function as a water storage, which really makes the camel resistant. The secret to survive the drought is that the camel can withstand dehydration. The average person loses 12% of water in the desert and will die of heat stroke. Even if the camel loses 25% of its body weight, it can still survive, but it only loses some weight. The reason is that after a person loses water, the blood becomes sticky and burdens the heart, but the water lost by the camel does not affect the blood, and once the dehydrated camel is replenished with water, it will immediately recover.

Other scholars have suggested that fat stored in humps can be oxidized to produce water. One gram of fat can be oxidized to produce 1.37 grams of water, and about 40 kilograms of fat are stored in one hump, which is equivalent to 50 kilograms of water. Other scholars believe that the camel's drought resistance is due to its excellent water-holding ability, and it rarely sweats, and its temperature does not rise. Others believe that camels urinate less, which is why they are resistant to drought.

Recently, scientists have discovered that camels can reduce the exhaled humidity, thereby saving water. Camels lose 45% less water than normal animals through breathing. Even so, people have a superficial understanding of the magical functions of the camel. There are still many fans of the camel body E, waiting for us to crack.
