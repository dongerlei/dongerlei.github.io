To answer this question, we have to start with a strange stone discovered more than 130 years ago.

In the autumn of 1861, in a place called Solhofen in southern Germany, the physician Karl Hazlin found a strange stone on a limestone rock wall with a painting engraved on the surface, which looks like a painting. Small animal, about the size of a crow. Its head is particularly like a lizard, its jaws have serrated teeth, and its slender tail is made of a series of tail vertebrae, resembling the skeleton of a reptile crocodile. But it had flying wings and feathers. Of imprints. What kind of monster is this?

"Dr. Haberin and the people present looked and looked, and no one could figure it out. In the end, he simply took the stone out of the cyan limestone and sent it to the zoologist to understand it.

The stone was sent to the scholars' desks and looked at this strange stone animal. No one could name it for a moment.

In the process of research, a scholar learned from the book "The Origin of Species": British biologist Charles Darwin believed that animals evolved in the process of adapting to the natural environment. The scholar was excited to tell colleagues:

"You see, this animal not only retains the characteristics of reptiles, but also has the characteristics of birds. Is it the ancestor II tooth of birds?"

Other zoologists agreed with him and finally came to the conclusion that this is a fossil of an ancient bird. The ancient bird that formed this fossil was named "Archaeopteryx", which means "the beginning of the wings". And by analyzing its morphological characteristics, it is concluded that the class evolved from reptiles.

According to scientists, Archaeopteryx has lived for about 150 million years. This ancient bird has the form of a transition from a reptile to Baimisha. It has many characteristics of reptiles: it has teeth, its tail is composed of 18 to 21 separate tail vertebrae, its forelimbs have 3 separate metacarpal bones, and its fingers have claws. But it also has feathers and wings, four toes on the hind feet, and three fronts and one back. This is a characteristic of birds, so it is also a courtier. Trainers put the Archaeopteryx's Hukou in the "Ancient Bird Subclass" under the "Bird Gang".

Are Archaeopteryx really the earliest ancestors of birds?

Later, some people questioned this conclusion. They believed that the evolution from reptiles with non-constant body temperature and no feathers to constant temperature and blood and king bags should be a long process, not to say that change will change. These zoologists speculate that there should be older birds before Archaeopteryx Archaeopteryx could not be the most primitive bird. They also pointed out that the time between the evolution of Archaeopteryx to many modern birds is too short. Just when these scholars were struggling to find bird fossils earlier than the original bird to prove their speculation, the good news came: Chatterjee, a paleontologist at Texas Tech University, near Post City In the stratum 25 million years ago, fossils of two ancient birds were found. This discovery ecstatic scholars, because it confirms that their speculation is correct.

These two ancient birds lived 75 million years before the archaeopteryx lived! It is worthy to call them ancestors of birds. Therefore, paleontologists named them "original birds", which means "sister first bird".

The ancestral bird is about the same size as a crow, and it is more like a current bird than an archaeopteryx. It has slender forelimbs, a keel-like sternum, a skull exactly like modern birds, and the back of the collar is toothless. But it still has some characteristics of reptiles, such as 4 teeth in front of the jaw, a long tail and band fingers.

But some people have also questioned why since the newly discovered ancestor bird appeared earlier than the archaeopteryx, why is it more like a modern bird? How can this be explained? Paleontologist Chatterjee believes that ancestors may be direct ancestors of modern birds, so they evolved faster. They are a positive source in the evolution of birds. They are like the trunk of a big tree, and Archaeopteryx may be just a branch of this big tree, so there is little development.

Are the ancestors of birds the ancestral birds? It is not yet possible to draw such conclusions. When the news of the ancestral bird's fossils was just announced, some people expressed suspicion. Paleobiologists from the University of Nauru in the United States pointed out that the ancestral bird's fossils were "a bizarre and unlikely discovery" because of the bones of birds. Very fragile, it is difficult to be so intact. The professor suspected that it was not a fossil of a bird at all.

It seems that research on the origin of birds needs to continue.
