<div class="page_title">Can a single tree become a forest</div>

  <p>As the saying goes, a single tree cannot make a forest. However, in the plant world, there is a single plant that can make a forest.</p>
<p>There is a famous "bird paradise" in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, because there is a dense forest covering an area of ​​about 0.6 hectares and inhabiting many birds. However, this forest was grown from a banyan tree. This giant ficus has a history of at least 300 years. The trunk under the tree canopy is dense, and it has grown so thick that people can't tell which one is the main one or the branch.</p>
<p>In the center of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in Yunnan, there is a large banyan tree with many aerial roots pierced into the soil, which together support the lush foliage. With the support of aerial roots, the branches extend far to the surroundings, so that the shade area is about 0.2 hectares, which can accommodate hundreds of people to cool under the trees.</p>
<p>In the Jessore region of Bangladesh, there is a famous banyan tree. It has a tree age of more than 900 years, more than 600 branches, a tree height of 4 meters, a huge crown, and a projection area of ​​about 28,000 square meters.</p>
<p>Why can a big banyan tree grow alone?</p>
<p>The banyan tree grows in hot and rainy tropical and subtropical regions. It has lush foliage and is evergreen all year round. The banyan tree has a distinctive habit, and its trunk and branches will grow aerial roots like beards. When these aerial roots grow to a certain time, they can come into contact with the soil. Slowly, the aerial roots grow longer and thicker, forming a branch. These branches can not only support the huge canopy, but also absorb nutrients and water from the soil to meet the needs of a large number of branches and leaves.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of aerial roots and the growing strength of aerial roots, it provides the necessary conditions for the canopy to extend around. Therefore, after a long time, a banyan tree has become a forest.</p>
