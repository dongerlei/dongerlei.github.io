<div class="page_title">Not afraid of trees</div>

  <p>Ordinary trees are most afraid of being cut by axe during the growth process. However, there are also "hard bones" in the tree that are not afraid of cutting with swords and axe. Mango trees are such "hard bones" in trees.</p>
<p>Mango tree, an evergreen tree belonging to the lacaceae and mango genus. The canopy grows luxuriantly and is spherical; the bark is thick and dark gray; the trunk is tall and sturdy; the tree is 10-20 meters high; the life span can reach hundreds of years. There is a story circulating in the folk: a long time ago, a Lingnan man escaped from the government to escape from Nanyang, and lived on planting flowers and trees. The mango tree he planted was strong, thick, thick and dense. It didn't take long for him to become a local mango farmer. This popularity didn't matter. After the government found out the news, they sent someone to Nanyang to hunt him down. Because he evaded quickly, when the people in the government chased Nanyang, no one else was visible. The government did not catch anyone, so he sent someone to hack the mango tree with a knife. But I did not expect that the mango tree that was cut by the knife produced more fruit than the tree that was not cut by the knife. Later, people also learned how to cut trees with a knife to promote production, so the "knife to cut trees" method was passed down.</p>
<p>People gradually came to understand the scientific principle of the slashing method to promote fruitfulness. Because the leaves and leaves of mango are dense, a large amount of nutrients synthesized by photosynthesis are transmitted to the roots by the transportation line for the purpose of thickening and stretching the root system. Too much nutrient input to the roots will result in insufficient nutrient accumulation in branches and leaves, which will affect flowering and fruiting. If the bark is cut open, you can prevent excessive nutrients from entering the roots, and nutrient-rich branches can promote more flowering, flowers bloom more, and the fruits naturally bear much fruit.</p>
<p>It is said that mango is native to India. Mango has been cultivated in India for more than 4,000 years. Interestingly, the first monk to make Mango famous was the Chinese monk Tang Xuanzhang.</p>
<p>Now, people have taken a more scientific approach to replace the knife-cut method to achieve a greater harvest of mango.</p>
