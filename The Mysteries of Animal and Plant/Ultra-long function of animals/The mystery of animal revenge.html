<div class="page_title">The mystery of animal revenge</div>

  <p>Can animals retaliate? The answer is yes, and there are various ways of revenge. Here are a few things about animal revenge.</p>
<p>In Emeishan, Sichuan Province, China, there is a group of wild monkeys jumping around. They bring a lot of fun to people who travel. But whoever hurts it, keep it in mind and look for opportunities to get revenge. One day, a young man grabbed a peanut to amuse the monkey, and he said, "Come, eat!" A monkey jumped a few times, but the young man didn't give a peanut. The monkey was in a hurry, jumped up and scratched the young man's hand, and the peanuts were scattered, making the people next to them laugh. The boy was so angry and anxious that he picked up a wooden cane and swept over the monkey who was eating peanuts. The monkey was squeaked and squeaked, dragging its injured leg into the woods. Its leg was broken and it became a marmoset.</p>
<p>In the second year, the monkey-beater came again. When walking to Xianfeng Temple, I saw a monkey sitting in the middle of the road, which was going to be eaten by tourists. This monkey was injured by the lad last year. It recognized the enemy at a glance, and hurriedly hid behind it. When the lad walked past it, the glass monkey jumped cold and bite hard After the young man took a sip, he screamed "Ai Mingming" with pain, and his legs and stomach were bitten with blood. He turned around and saw that the monkey had been on the tree and made a face at him. Then the monkey beating man suddenly realized that the monkey had come to avenge him. Who keeps him from loving wildlife?</p>
<p>In the Chongqing Zoo, there was a golden monkey king. It seemed to think that it had a noble bloodline, a bad temper, and bite the breeder at every turn. Once the breeder was slow to deliver food, the monkey king ran over and broke the breeder's hand. In order to punish it, the breeder picked up the bamboo stick and pumped it on his ass a few times. The monkey king felt lost face and kept this in mind. A few days later, the breeder was transferred. Six months later, he returned to the zoo to visit the golden monkeys he had raised. Unexpected things happened. The monkey king recognized the breeder who had beaten it from the crowd. If he wanted to get revenge and couldn't find anything, he pulled down a group and threw it at the breeder's head. The monkeys made him look so funny that the Golden Monkey King was very proud.</p>
<p>In the beautiful Xishuangbanna, there are often wild elephants infested, they are the protected animals of our country. On this day, a hunter found a deer drinking water by the river and raised his shotgun to aim. Just when he was about to shoot, a roar suddenly came, scaring him into a panic. Looking back, I saw an elephant approaching him. The hunter recognized it. He shot the elephant with a gun a few days ago, but he missed it. It was revenge. The hunter hurriedly turned his muzzle at the elephant and panicked, but missed. The elephant ran towards him in anger, and the hunter turned and ran. Unexpectedly, he was tripped by Noto, and his shotgun was thrown away. The elephant broke the shotgun with one foot up, rolled it up with its nose and threw it far away. The hunter got up from the ground and escaped dead, the revengeful elephant chased after him, and forced the hunter to the cliff. He hurriedly grabbed a rough vine, trying to climb up a cliff to escape. The elephant raised his nose, rolled up the hunter, and threw it out vigorously. With a scream, the hunter was killed under the cliff. This is the end of the poacher.</p>
<p>In Xishuangbanna, there is a village called Windy Village, and there is a small river beside the village. One day, a mother elephant took a baby elephant to take a bath in the river, and Xiaojia was so happy to see the water that she felt happy. When the elephant mother and child were having fun, they were spotted by several hunters in the village, and shot with a shotgun. The poor baby elephant was just as soon as it climbed up the river bank. The mother elephant immediately became angry.<br />
Howling ran up ashore, stroking the baby elephant's wound with his nose, very sad. It ran and jumped for a while, roaring loudly, and then arched the tree with its nose, until it was exhausted, it left the baby elephant reluctantly, and went back to the deep forest step by step.</p>
<p>Two days later, this mother elephant came with a dozen elephants for revenge. When the elephant herd rushed into the windy village, the young adults in the village went to work in the mountains. The elderly and children who stayed at home had to escape everywhere. The elephant didn't chase, but arched the bamboo house in the walled village upside down, and then swaggered into the forest. When the villagers returned to the village, they blamed the hunters who poached elephants.</p>
<p>Such things have happened in India. A group of domesticated elephants carried goods into the city. After unloading the goods, one of the elephants took a walk along the road. When passing by a tailor shop, the elephant curiously stuck his nose into the window. A sewing worker who was making clothes casually pierced his elephant nose. The elephant hurriedly retracted its nose and left. I did not expect a few months later. The elephant came again, sucked a nose of water from the fountain in the center of the street, came to the tailor's shop window, sprayed the sewing worker into a falling chicken, and then left.</p>
<p>Leopards have also retaliated against hunters in India. A hunter living in the forest of Kacha, killed two little leopards who were still feeding while hunting up the mountain. This angered the female leopard, who followed the hunter secretly, remembering his residence, waiting for the opportunity to retaliate. Two days later, the hunter's wife went to work in a field near the forest and brought a two-year-old son. While the hunter's wife lowered her head to work, she suddenly heard the call of the child. Looking up, I saw a leopard holding her child, and ran to the forest in Feishan, she called and chased desperately, and did not chase E.</p>
<p>Three years later, the hunter killed a female leopard on the mountain. There were two young leopards and a living boy in the leopard's lair. It doesn't matter if you identify it carefully, this "leopard boy" is his son who was snatched by the mother leopard three years ago. This is the revenge of the female leopard.</p>
<p>In the animal world, bison's revenge is also strong. In Kenya, Africa, there is a Turkan resident named Abeya who has just hunted with a shotgun. He hid in the bush on the hillside and ambushed the bison, waited and waited, and found one, he hit with a gun and hit the bison's belly. The injured bison escaped, and Abeya chased after him, but the bison hid in the forest. Abeya didn't give up, so he followed the blood of the bison, chasing and looking at the blood on the ground. Sometimes he could not see clearly, and he bent down and looked carefully on the ground. At this moment, the injured bison found a chance for revenge, and rushed from behind. Before Abeya could get up straight, he was knocked to the ground. The bison slammed his head against him, and the deputy killed him. Just give up.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, an oil shop owner has an old camel. Once, the boss lost money in the business and was full of resentment. When he got home, he whipped the camel with a whip to suffocate. One night a few months later, the beaten camel came out of the camel shed and quietly came out of the owner's tent. After standing for a while, he suddenly rushed into the tent and threw it at the owner's bed. Fortunately, the owner of the Youfang workshop was not home. The old camel was so angry that he tore his master's quilt into pieces. It was not deflated, and he smashed the utensils used by the master, and then left with satisfaction.</p>
<p>How did animals' revenge arise, and how can their revenge be explained? This requires scientists to continue their research and discussion.</p>
