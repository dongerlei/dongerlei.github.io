<div class="page_title">Monster corpse found in Oceania</div>

  <p>To date, one piece of evidence for monsters is the remains of monster corpses obtained from the Japanese fishing vessel "Ruiyangmaru", as well as 4 color photos of the corpses and sketches of bones drawn on the scene.</p>
<p>On April 25, 1977, the sun was shining and sparkling. On the sea more than 50 kilometers east of Crestchurch, New Zealand, the Japanese ocean fishing company's ocean trawler "Ruiyangmaru" was fishing and was a crew member. When they dragged a fishing net more than 300 meters below the sea, everyone was shocked: they saw the body of a monster that had never seen it wrapped in the net. In order to see what happened, people tied the monster with a rope. The middle of the corpse was lifted by a crane. This is a reptile-like corpse, with a small head, a slender neck, two pairs of huge fins, a big belly, an abdomen that is empty, and no internal organs. At that time, it was estimated that it had died for more than a month, and after research and analysis, it had been dead for half a year to a year. Although the body had begun to decay, the entire body remained intact. People measured with a tape measure about 10 meters in length, 1.5 meters in length, 2 meters in tail length, and about 2 tons in weight. No crew member who has been fishing on the boat for many years knows it. Some people say that it looks like the legendary Loch Ness monster.</p>
<p>When everyone was shocked, the captain arrived and saw everyone surrounded by a rotten and stinky monster body. He couldn't help but jump like a storm. He worried that the fish in the cabin would be affected by the rot, and ordered everyone to throw the monster body back to the sea . The chance that humans may know a new animal is so sadly lost.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Yano Yano, who accompanied the ship, found the discovery unusual, so he took four photos and took notes. He also drew sketches of monster bones. Several good crew members also left four. Fifty monster fins. From the color photos taken by Mr. Yano, it can be clearly seen that the monster's spine is large, with two pairs of huge mistakes, the abdomen is empty, the whole body muscles are still intact, and only the head is exposed with white bones. In terms of body size, only whales, giant sharks, and Malaysia can be compared. The monster's small head and two symmetrical pairs of giant fins are not found in whale sharks. None of the currently known marine life can be compared with it.</p>
<p>Although the above records and objects are very valuable, you must rely on them to determine which animal the monster belongs to. Since there is no comprehensive object, it cannot be compared with the known ancient bones of various animals and paleontology, so it is impossible Make a conclusion. Japanese biologists all said with emotion: "Even if you bring back a small tooth and bone!"</p>
<p>What exactly is a monster? People's views are different. There are two main views: one is the ancient snake-necked dragon theory; the other is the modern big shark theory. The basis for agreeing with the shark is that the Tokyo Fisheries University in Japan conducted a protein analysis of the monster's fin and found that its composition resembles a shark fin and whisker. Some biologists in Britain and the United States agree with this view. Owes Wheeler of the Natural Museum of London in the United Kingdom believes that this monster may be a shark. Many exotic animals have been found near the seafronts around the world before, and it turns out that they are all sharks. A shark is a cartilage fish without hard bones. When it gradually rots after death, the head and gills are detached from the body first, so it presents a slender neck attached to the front of the body. The tip is like a small Small head. Wheeler's argument convinced many people.</p>
<p>People who say that the snake-necked dragon thinks: first, the shark's meat is white, the tadpole is pink, and the monster is red; second, the shark has no urinary organs, and the urine accumulated in the body is saturated with seawater. Stress, it is excreted throughout the body, so shark meat has a special urine odor, which can be smelled by all experienced fishermen. But no one at the crew who caught the monster's body smelled this urine smell. Third, if it was a shark, then a shark with soft bones died more than six months after death and it was difficult to lift it with a crane. Because the cartilage will also change when the corpse begins to rot, the soft skeleton of the corpse cannot bear about 2 tons of body weight anyway. In addition, sharks only have fat in the liver, while monsters have thicker layers of fat that surround the muscles of the body. Another important argument is that the monster's head is triangular, which is unique to reptiles. People have compared the skeleton sketches of monsters with the fossil skeletons of snake-necked dragons, and they have amazing similarities both in terms of the entire skeleton structure and local fins, tails and necks. It should be emphasized that the sketch of the monster's skeleton was drawn based on Yano's visual inspection and speculation, which is not completely accurate, but its structure is so similar to that of the short-necked snake-necked dragon, and it has to be said that this snake-necked dragon has a certain basis. Japanese cartoonist Ishimori Akira drew a picture of a monster based on a skeleton sketch. If you look at it, it really looks like a snake-necked dragon.</p>
<p>On September 1 and 19, 1977, Japan held two academic seminars on monsters. Participants were experts in paleontology, ichthyology and other fields. They synthesized opinions from various aspects and wrote 9 papers after research and analysis. The host of the meeting, Tajiki Sasaki, President of Tokyo Fisheries University, published the conclusions of Japanese academic research to the press on December 15. From the chemical composition of the monster's whiskers, the conclusion of the shark cannot be reached; from the two pairs of giant fins of the monster In terms of characteristics such as, long body, long tail, and body surface, it is an animal that is completely different from the fishes known so far; in terms of taxonomy, it is likely to represent a brand-new large class of unknown animals ( Marine reptiles)?</p>
<p>What exactly is a monster on the Pacific Ocean? People are waiting, hoping that one day they will reappear the traces of monsters, in order to unravel this great mystery of the 20th century.</p>
