<div class="page_title">The Dinosaur Age</div>

  <p>The first discovery of dinosaur fossils by paleontologists was only a century and a half ago. By 1842, dinosaur fossils had been discovered quite a lot. People had to list this ancient animal in a single item. British scientist Irving put this in Greek. This kind of ugly eight monster is named "terrible lizard", and the Chinese translation is "dinosaur".</p>
<p>Scientists speculate that about 200 million years ago, the sun was shining everywhere on the earth, there was no snow in the north and south poles, and there was no desert yellow sand on the equator. Plants are thriving and animals are endless. Dominating this fascinating world is the huge reptiles-dinosaurs. Dinosaurs have been on the planet for 130 million years. But somehow, 250 million dinosaurs died out suddenly 7 million years ago. Along with the dinosaurs were other animals and plants. German paleontologist Ei Hannick once vividly described this most puzzling page in the history of the earth: "The face of the world has changed drastically! The typical representatives of small creatures and the large vertebrates that dominate the oceans and continents have inexplicably withdrawn. The stage of life ... "</p>
<p>Darwin said that to understand the causes of species extinction, one must first know how they used to live on their strengths. How does a dinosaur live? These dominaters of the earth at that time, were they temperature-changing animals or thermostatic animals? Is it some dumb fool, or is it an agile and energetic earth pride? Despite the change of time, scientists have studied arduously, and they have painted wonderful flowers for us, and they have described for us the difficult life of dinosaurs in the past and the ability to support their families.</p>
<p>For a long time, humans have always believed that since dinosaurs belong to reptiles, they are naturally temperature-changing (cold-blooded) animals. However, in recent years, Buck and others at Harvard University in the United States, after systematic and in-depth research, believe that dinosaurs are not low-temperature temperature-changing animals, but thermostatic animals. Although the temperature of dinosaurs is lower than that of modern mammals and the mechanism of regulating body temperature is worse, a large number of facts strongly support this new insight, especially the results of research on the bone structure of modern dragons, which are fundamentally shaken People's traditional concepts about dinosaurs. The main items of Buck's research are the comparative study on the distribution of dinosaur fossils in the time and six, the proportion of plant-eating dinosaurs and carnivorous dinosaurs in the community, and the ecology of dinosaur populations. The research results of this project have given more support to Buck's new insights. Especially in the study of skeletal tissue, it was found that the temperature of animals with low temperature is low, so the blood vessel density on bone is low, and the place where calcium and phosphorus are quickly exchanged-there are few Haves' blood vessels. When they hibernate, as they grow slowly, they will grow in a sparse range of growth rings that resemble tree rings. Obviously, a constant temperature animal has no growth ring.</p>
<p>In the study of bone tissue, Buck found that the bones of dinosaurs have richer blood vessels and more Haversian canals, and the blood vessel density is higher than that of some mammals. No growth ring has been found, which proves that dinosaurs do not have Hibernated. Therefore, Buck believes that dinosaurs are not low-energy temperature-changing animals, but are "internal heat" animals or constant-temperature animals that have high body temperature and have obtained constant temperature equipment. Do dinosaurs have intelligence? Now many new discoveries prove that dinosaurs are not the stupid and simple limbs described in the past. On the contrary, many species of dinosaurs are agile and energetic earth pride.</p>
<p>From the study of dinosaur fossils, it is known that the huge body of dinosaurs is indeed incomparably small compared to their smaller brains. But from the anatomical perspective of animal evolution, any large vertebrate has a relatively small brain compared to the small vertebrates associated with it. This is because the body size of vertebrates is growing faster than the brain size. Many biological materials prove that the growth rate of the brain is only about two thirds of the growth rate of the body. From this point of view, compared with smaller animals, larger animals need relatively smaller brains to perform the same tasks as small animals. In this way, it is not surprising that reptiles, including dinosaurs, have relatively small brains. So, how is the intelligence of dinosaurs determined? It is calculated by applying mathematical methods to measure the "brain quotient" (E.Q.) of dinosaurs. The "brain quotient" refers to the ratio of the average brain mass of living reptiles compared to the brain mass of each dinosaur calculated according to a certain calculation method. Therefore, the "brain quotient" is a ruler for measuring the brain size of all dinosaurs.</p>
<p>With E.Q., a ruler for quantitative research, we can completely arrange and distinguish the intelligence of the main groups according to the increase in the average E.Q. of various dinosaurs. Studies have found that the average size of dinosaur E.Q. is closely related to its food habits and agility. For example, Thunder Dragon and its counterparts are famous behemoths among dinosaurs, but their EQ is relatively low, only 0.2 ~ 0.35, so they have slow movements, poor flexibility, and the only way to escape the enemy is to rely on a huge body or to hide Free from flesh and blood in ponds or lakes. Dinosaurs, like mammals, have a higher brain mass quotient than meat-eating ones. For example, the fierce Tyrannosaurus Rex and its similar E.Q. have reached 1 ~ 2. What's more, the Possibility of Narrow Crouching Dragon and Dire-toed Dragon has exceeded 5. Take the dinosaur as an example. This small man with an unbelievable appearance stands only over 1 meter tall and is only 3.5 meters from head to tail, but it is equipped with 3 large sharp claws on the front and back limbs. When encountering prey, You only need to stand one leg up and three feet out, and use the sharp claws to pounce on the other side. The speed of action is far more than that of Tyrannosaurus Rex. This is not only manifested in the physical shape, but also the EQ is three or four times greater than that of T. rex Reflected.</p>
<p>It can be seen that E.Q. is not only a measure of the intelligence of dinosaurs, but also a concrete reflection of their living habits. The difference in E.0. Also makes us want to believe that dinosaurs are not born stupid, and can spend more than 100 million years on earth, which is the most convincing. Mamenchisaurus is a typical herbivorous dinosaur. Like other dinosaurs, its huge body drive with a small mouth is simply not proportional. Therefore, some people estimate that, like Mamenchisaurus, you need to eat 300 kilograms a day. Sustain life, and the narrow mouth and sparse teeth cannot adapt to the processing of many foods. Even if they chew and swallow there for 24 hours, I am afraid that they cannot complete the task of filling the belly, let alone dinosaurs have to act, sleep and rest. How to explain it?</p>
<p>In fact, such a simple inference cannot explain the problem. Because the purpose of eating animals is to supplement energy consumption. At the same time, the metabolism of reptiles is far less vigorous than that of mammals, and the demand for food is necessarily lower than that of mammals. Moreover, the energy supply is closely related to the nutritional value of foods. Foods with high nutritional value can be used in small amounts. In addition to the rich aquatic plants, the marsh area where Mamenxilong lives is rich in a variety of algae with high nutritional value and rich in protein and fat. Living in a more auspicious environment, why worry about filling your belly? Generally speaking,<br />
Carnivorous dinosaurs are fierce and have fangs and claws, making them a powerful tool for capturing prey. Most of the people hunted were herbivorous dinosaurs or small carnivorous dinosaurs that lacked resistance. Among many carnivorous fear dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus Rex is a certain representative. Tyrannosaurus. As the name suggests, it is a veritable "tyrant" in the dinosaur family.</p>
<p>One of the largest tyrannosaurus resembles at least three elephants. Tyrannosaurus rex's biggest features are big head, big mouth and big teeth. Because its jaw joint is far away from the back of the head, when the mouth is open, a large object like a basketball can bite down without any effort. In particular, the fine and sharp jagged teeth make many small dinosaurs intimidated. As long as they encounter Tyrannosaurus Rex, they are more ferocious and less fortunate. Because Tyrannosaurus Rex's strong hind limbs can move fast and fast, its short forelimbs are as flexible as hands, and even if the arrested person wants to slip away, he cannot escape its clutches. Here, we might as well look at the battle scene of hunting food while Yongchuan Dragon found in Sichuan, China. Yongchuan Dragon is not as tall as Tyrannosaurus Rex, with a total length of about 8 meters and only about 4 meters when standing, it belongs to "little man". But its predatory action is flexible and its capture efficiency is high. Yongchuan dragons often appear in the jungle, staring at its prey one by one—the Mamenxi dragon, the Emei dragon, and the Jianjiang dragon with sword plates. Mamenxi Dragon, who lives near the lake and in the swamp area, stretches his crane-like neck slowly and looks around, for fear of meeting Yongchuan Dragon. Wearing a sword armor, the Minjiang Dragon foraged on the high ground, relying on the protection of the sword armor on both sides of its back, and forgot the enemy for a while. Suddenly, a fierce tiger-like Yongchuan dragon rushed over, held down the Hujiang dragon with his front paws, opened his mouth like a blood basin, and a pair of sharp teeth instantly smashed the Hujiang dragon and had a meal. ...</p>
<p>However, carnivorous dinosaurs are not always easy to prey on. It often takes a lot of trouble and encounters some opponents who are difficult to subdue. Maybe they have also broken their blood and disappointed them. For example, Ceratosaurus dared to fight against Tyrannosaurus Rex to compete for height. Because this kind of horned dragons sometimes cluster in groups of three or five, once they find that the Tyrannosaurus rebellion is out of order and enters their sphere of influence, they will attack in groups. Groups of horned dragons, using their hard heads and stabs at Tyrannosaurus Rex, had to bite the flesh of Tyrannosaurus Rex with its beak-like end. Tyrannosaurus relied on an army to fight alone.</p>
